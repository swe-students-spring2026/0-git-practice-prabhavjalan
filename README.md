# What I Found Interesting About This
This article is noteworthy because it contends that the most difficult aspect of software engineering is not coding, but rather dealing with complex, ambiguous systems and the emotional pressures that surround them. It demonstrates how actual work frequently entails reading complicated legacy code, making meticulous modifications, and remaining calm when production fails and everyone is watching.

It also redefines "good" as not understanding everything, but communicating properly, asking better questions, and fixing problems without making them worse. The honesty about burnout, inconsistent coaching, and imposter syndrome makes it feel more like real engineering than the typical "just learn the basics" story.
